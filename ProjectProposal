 
Project Proposal:

-	Olympics medal data (question: do countries with higher GDP per capita have more medals?)
-	Does economic success relate to higher medal count as a result of more resources for athletes?
-	Comparison between winter and summer olympics
-	Based on conclusions and past data, make predictions on 2021 Olympics

Project 1 Proposal â€“ Danny De La Torre, Juan Salicrup, Christine Robertson
 
-	Analyzing Olympics medal count vs. country GDP from the World Bank dataset
-	Medal count vs. population

Stretch goals:
Comparison between winter and summer Olympics

-	Do countries with higher GDP have a higher medal count?
-	Do countries with a higher population have a higher medal count?
-	Does economic success relate to higher medal count as a result of more resources for athletes?
